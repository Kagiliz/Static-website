<h1 style="color:blueviolet">The tea leaves</h1>
<p>It is so amazing to leave near the tea bushes and being able to own an estate.</p>
<p>The tea estate is owned by Mrs.Lilian Kihara who is also the Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>Many workers have been employed to work this includes the minor patners who also help in managing the business.</p>
<p>It is also facinating when it comes to the sunrise that happens every early morning.</p>
<p>This is quit intresting and for those who have not seen it should make sure they do.</p>
